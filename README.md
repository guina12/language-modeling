# Baby Name Generator using Language Model (Bigram)

## Overview

This project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create a baby name generation model. Harnessing the power of language models, we developed an innovative solution for generating unique and meaningful name suggestions.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a comprehensive database containing:
- Total of 32,023 names
- Diversity of origins and cultures
- Male and female names


## 1- First version

In this first version of the project, we created a simpler model, with only a one-hot encoding layer for text representation and an activation function, without embeddings, without MLP... List the "withouts."
 - Without embeddings
 - Without MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
 - Without advanced representations
 - Without complex layers (such as RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers)
 - Without attention mechanisms
 - Without deep learning with multiple layers
